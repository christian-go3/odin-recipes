# odin-recipes

This is a basic recipe website for an HTML skills practice project for the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths) curriculum.

In this project, I will practice the HTML skills I learned in the [HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations) section and the basic Git/GitHub workflow skills I learned in the [Git Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#git-basics) section.
